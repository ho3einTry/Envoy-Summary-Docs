Load Balancing:
	1.Distributed Load Balancing:
	Examples:
		1.Active health checking
		2.Zone aware routing
		3.Load balancing algorithms
	2.Global Load Balancing
	Global load balancing refers to having a single, global authority that decides how load should be distributed between hosts.
	For Envoy, this would be done by the control plane, which is able to adjust the load applied to individual endpoints 
	by specifying various parameters, such as priority, locality weight, endpoint weight and endpoint health.

Both Distributed and Global:Recommended
