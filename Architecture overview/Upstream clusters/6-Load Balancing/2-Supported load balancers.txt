Supported load balancers:

1. Weighted round robin
2.Weighted least request
	1.all weights equal
	2.all weights not equal:
	weight = load_balancing_weight / (active_requests + 1)^active_request_bias

active_request_bias can be configured via runtime and defaults to 1.0. 
It must be greater than or equal to 0.0.

The larger the active request bias is, 
the more aggressively active requests will lower the effective weight.

If active_request_bias is set to 0.0, 
the least request load balancer behaves like the round robin load balancer and ignores the active request count at the time of picking.

For example, if active_request_bias is 1.0, a host with weight 2 and an active request count of 4 will have an effective weight of 2 / (4 + 1)^1 = 0.4. 

=>This algorithm provides good balance at steady state but may not adapt to load imbalance as quickly. 
Additionally, unlike P2C, a host will never truly drain, though it will receive fewer requests over time.
