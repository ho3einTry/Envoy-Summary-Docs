This can be done by compare  the value of the 
	"x-envoy-upstream-healthchecked-cluster" response header 
	to "service_name_matcher" option value

Envoy supports marking certain endpoints as degraded, 
meaning that they are able to receive traffic, 
but should only receive traffic once 
there are not sufficient healthy hosts available.
