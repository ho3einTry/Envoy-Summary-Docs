Connection pooling:
	1.HTTP/1.1:
		only a single downstream request must be reset 
		if the upstream connection is severed
	2.HTTP/2:
		The HTTP/2 connection pool multiplexes multiple requests over a single connection, 
		up to the limits imposed by "max concurrent streams" and "max requests per connection"
		=>"maximum requests per connection","maximum concurrent stream limit"
	3.HTTP/3: Like HTTP/2

Automatic protocol selection:
For Envoy acting as a forward proxy, the preferred configuration is the AutoHttpConfig
=>"<envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.upstreams.http.v3.HttpProtocolOptions.AutoHttpConfig>"
=>"<envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.upstreams.http.v3.HttpProtocolOptions>"


Number of connection pools:

if the cluster supports multiple upstream protocols, 
then unless it is using ALPN, 
one connection pool per protocol may be allocated.

Each worker thread maintains its own connection pools for each cluster, 
so if an Envoy has two threads and a cluster with both HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 support, 
there will be at least 4 connection pools.
